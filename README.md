# Personal Portfolio

## Overview

Hi! :wave: I'm Amy and I'm a Front End Software Developer. I began building this personal portfolio in January 2022, at the beginning of my coding journey with [Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org/).

:computer: As I continue to learn, I continue to update my projects.

The latest version of my portfolio was inspired by [this website template](https://www.canva.com/templates/EAEveUhu84M-green-and-black-colorful-blocks-newbie-presentation-internal-communication-website/).
